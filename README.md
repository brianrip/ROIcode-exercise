Coding Exercise:

Write a program in Java that converts a sentence from English to Inflationary English. Inflationary English takes words and word parts that sound the same as a number (e.g. “won” v. “one”) and then inflates that to the next number (e.g. “won” becomes “two”). Provide tests for your program.

Example of input and output:

Input: “Today I won an award for being awesome.”
Output: “Threeday I two an award five being awesome."
